# Dialogflow Testing Tool

This respository contains a testing framework that I developed as part of the creation of a Google Assistant/Dialogflow application that uses  [Interactive Canvas](https://developers.google.com/actions/interactivecanvas/).

In general, one considers such applications to be "dual appications," in that the it provides an Immersive Response to surfaces that support this capability, as well as a traditional, message-scroll Simple Response for surfaces that do notsupport the Custom Stage actions capability.
